## üîå JDBC Connectivity Steps

Follow the steps below to set up JDBC connectivity between Java and MySQL:

1. Import JDBC Packages
import java.sql.*;'

2. Load and Register the JDBC Driver
   Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
   
3. Establish the Connection
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name", "your_username", "your_password");

4. Create a Statement
   Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
   
5. Execute the Query
  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM your_table_name");

6. Process the Result
   while(rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getString("column_name"));
}

7. Close the Connection
  rs.close();
  stmt.close();
 con.close();
